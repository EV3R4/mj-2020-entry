# Teleport Maze [post-jam]
A game I made for the Mid-Jam 2020 together with [Dr. Wuro](https://drwuro.itch.io/) in less than a day.

## How to play
The goal is the exit of the maze, you will need to go through a lot of teleporters to get there!

Some teleporters will have levers with the same colors.

## Controls
Left/Right/Up/Down - Movement
